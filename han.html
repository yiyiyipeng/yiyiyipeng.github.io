        <h1>HAN</h1>
        <p>Type : Course project </p>
        <p>Time : June 2014</p>
        <p>What I did : Visual design / Web coding</p>
        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
         <p>HAN is an individual course project of “Basic Home Page Design” and aims to help Chinese young students to learn more about their own nation, HAN.</p>
         <p>I independently designed and coded within 1 month. Now I would like to talk about some highlights and details.</p>
         <p>The first challenge is how to keep a strong impression of HAN nation in users’ mind. I asked many people who are around me what is the most special factor. Most of their answer are Chinese ink painting. So I added many relevant elements.</p>

        <p><em>Navitation tab. </em></p>
        <p><em>The icon of current page is a stroke painted by Chinese brush.</em></p>
        <img src="assets/img/han/2.png">
        <p><em>Bottom page</em></p>

        <p>Also, in order to let users turn to any part of current page they want, I designed a navigation tab with words so that they would not continually down their mouse's scroll wheels to browse the bottom of current page.</p>
