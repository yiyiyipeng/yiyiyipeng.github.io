        <h1>Revamping TravelLog iOS Experience</h1>
        <p>iOS application redesign | UX </p>
        <p>Individual Project</p>

        <h2>Background of The Subject</h2>
        <p>TravelLog is an existing app in China. It aims for those who are traveling to record their journey through posting pictures and moods and for those who are planning a travel to browse other’s sharing to make some preparation. What’s more, the log could be synchronized in the Web (qyer.com) to edit again and share to the community. </p>
        <p>It should be a perfect application for people to keep the good memories during traveling. However, because of the clunky and illogical design, many people can not complete a log and remove it after using it several times.</p>
        <p>As a travel buff, I am pretty sure that a better design could attract much more user to download it and be accustomed to use it.</p>

        <h2> How to find the problem of the original design </h2>

        <p>In order to explore the problem of the app, I  try to check the comments in app store. </p>
        <p>However, the insufficient ratings and a negligible number of reviews can not provide enough materials for my research and also mean that the application does not enjoy popularity among iPhone users.</p>
        <p>So I made a questionnaire and publish it on the internet. This was an intense project and everything went by fast, so I got 68 pieces of valid questionnaire within 3 days.  (Scan the QR code and review the questionnaire in Chinese.)</p>

        <h2>Analysis & Persona</h2>
        <p>By analyzing the data, I found that the major users can be divided into 2 groups and I made two personas to illustrate their characters and needs.</p>
